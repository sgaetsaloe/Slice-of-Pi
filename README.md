# https://sgaetsaloe.github.io/Slice-of-Pi/

This website was a final cumulative project demonstrating what I have learned in HTML and CSS. 
The prompt was to create a multi-page website on any topic with an original layout, design, and 3 distinct pages.
My final website is a resource to help people memorize the digits of pi with an interactive Java script page to quiz users.
See more details about the website in the projectproposal.pdf
